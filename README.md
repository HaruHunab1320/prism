# Project Prism

A programming language designed specifically for LLM interactions and probabilistic computing.

## Overview

Prism is a domain-specific language that brings probabilistic computing and LLM interactions into the core language design. It features:

- First-class support for confidence values and uncertainty
- Built-in context management
- Native LLM integration capabilities
- Advanced pattern matching with semantic understanding
- Source verification and hallucination prevention
