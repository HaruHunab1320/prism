# Prism Language

Prism is a domain-specific language designed for medical and healthcare applications with built-in LLM integration capabilities. It features confidence tracking, context management, and robust error handling.

## Current Status (v0.9)

The language is currently in late beta, with core features implemented and stabilizing for v1.0 release. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for detailed timeline and [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for current progress.
